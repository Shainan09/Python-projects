    "2. Line 50:  you are using the read() function to read the entire contents of the input file. Since these are all input records, the correct variable name to use would be payroll_input_records (plural to represent more than one input record that were read in. )\n",
    "3. Lines 98-102:  Why are you formatting numeric values in the record for the output file on lines 98-102. All float values should have been rounded to 2 decimal places BEFORE creating the output record.CSV files should never have formatted output as they may be used in further processing as input files. This is why your output csv file contents do not match with the sample provided. Too many gaps between individual fields. \n",
